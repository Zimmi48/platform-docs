# Structure of Coq's tutorial documentation

**This an informal draft**, established through informal discussions with the community, of what the documentation could look in terms of content.
**It is not fixed and will evolve with the project** through discussions and according to the need of the users.

# Detailed plan

## Preliminary
- Trying it out (games)
- Installing
- Courses and Books

## Writing proofs in Coq

### Basic tactics
- Reasoning about Logic
- Reasoning about Equality
- Reasoning about Inductive Types
- Proof Search tactics (assumption, easy, trivial, intuition ?)
- Tactics for Forward Reasoning
- Combining Tactics

### Solvers and Decision procedures
- Advanced Proof search tactics :
  - auto / eauto / typeclasses eauto
- Domain Specific Solvers :
  - congruence, bauto, tauto, first-order, lia, itauto, etc...
- Algebraic Solvers :
  - Ring etc... Algebra-tactics
- SMT Solvers
- CoqHammer

### SSReflect
- I guess there is much to say :smile:

### MetaProgramming, writing your own tactics
- Ltac
- Ltac2
- MTac2
- CoqElpi :
  - Tutorial
  - How to do sth that Elpi is good at
- MetaCoq


## Programming in Coq
- Writing programs in Coq
  - Termination / Well-founded
